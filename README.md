This project is a C++ application that renders and visualizes the Mandelbrot set using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The application allows for interactive exploration of the 
fractal by enabling zooming and panning. The fractal is color-coded based on the number of iterations for each point in the complex plane.

Features
  - Real-time Mandelbrot rendering: The Mandelbrot set is rendered as a collection of points on a 2D plane.
  - Zooming functionality: Users can zoom in and out by clicking the left or right mouse buttons.
  - Dynamic recentering: Users can recenter the view by clicking at any point in the window.
  - Color-coded fractal: Points are colored based on the number of iterations needed to determine if they belong to the Mandelbrot set.
  - Cross-platform: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS as long as SFML is installed.
